            From having same taste in music to having same list of people we don't like.
            <br>
            From knowing the importance of personal space to being there for each other in sad moments.
            <br>
            DAMN!GIRL we're such a clone copies emotionally.
            <br>
            From bitching about people(ONLY WHEN THEY'RE SUPER ANNOYING!!) and hating people who bitch about us at our backs we becomes US.
            <br>
